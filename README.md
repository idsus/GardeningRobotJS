This project, which involves the automated planting, watering, growing, trimming, and harvesting of crops using a robotic arm, shows the potential of automation in agriculture. It is a concept of a specific implementation of a basic way in the future, large-scale works. This system can be implemented in many areas, possibly even with wheels to get from place to place to grow and maintain crops. The automation can help in areas where food is scarce like deserts and other areas so that it makes the work of growing food much easier and accessible for people in these areas. The system can also be modified to grow and maintain trees in these dry areas to slow down the effects of climate change (and adapt to the changing weather patterns). Automation can greatly increase the efficiency and productivity of agricultural processes. The robotic arm in this project can perform repetitive tasks like planting seeds, watering plants, and harvesting crops with precision and speed, reducing the need for manual labor. This can lead to higher yields and more efficient use of resources Labor costs are a major expense in agriculture while decreasing labor costs and helping people in areas that lack farmers or food production. Automating this process can also make things more sustainable by precisely adding just enough resources that help yield more. The project can also help small-scale farmers by making sure that everything is affordable by implementing advanced agriculture techniques. In times of food security issues, as the number of people gets closer to running out of food for everyone, automation can ensure a stable food supply and make sure that there is enough. This project is a small step into making a secure and sustainable future to save the world.
